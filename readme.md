# AI Pet

Welcome to the AI Pet repository! This project aims to create a virtual pet powered by AI technologies. The pet can detect its owner using `facenet_pytorch`, detect the owner's emotions with `deepface`, and communicate with the owner using `dialoGPT`.

## Features

- **Owner Detection**: The AI pet can recognize its owner's face using the `facenet_pytorch` library.
- **Emotion Detection**: Using `deepface`, the pet can detect the owner's emotions, allowing for more personalized interactions.
- **Communication**: The pet can engage in conversations with the owner using `dialoGPT`, providing a unique and interactive experience.

## Web App

The repository includes a web app built with `Streamlit`, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the AI pet. Screenshots of the web app in action are included in the directory.

## Usage

To use the AI pet, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the web app using `streamlit run AI_Pet_Webapp.py`.
